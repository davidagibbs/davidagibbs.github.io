## *Creating a Portfolio website*

Would you like to make your best work available for the internet to see and ridicule? Well then strap in and
enjoy this brief walkthrough of how you can create a portfolio website using Github.

We are going to start by creating a Github repository so we will need to download [Github Desktop](https://www.github.com/apps/desktop/).

After installing that we will create a New Repository where you can manage all the files for your portfolio.

and then name your repository, select the location to store it, and choose the MIT license.
