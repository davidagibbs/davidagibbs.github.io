## *Creating a Portfolio website*

Would you like to make your best work available for the internet to see and ridicule? Well then strap in and
enjoy this brief walkthrough of how you too could create your very own portfolio website using Github.

First we are going to start by creating a Github repository.  We will need to download [Github Desktop](https://www.github.com/apps/desktop/).

After installing that we will create a New Repository where you can manage all the files for your portfolio.
